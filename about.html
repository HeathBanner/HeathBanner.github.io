                            I eventually picked up on technology in highschool.
                            The Xbox360 really ignited the flame within me. Going from a 
                            regular gamer to becoming a moderator on a very famous 
                            game modding website(<a href="https://www.thetechgame.com/" id="ttg">The Tech Game</a>).
                            A friend and I had released the first modded file for
                            Call of Duty BlackOps Zombies, a week before the game was
                            even released.

                        <p class="mainp">After highschool, my friend who was a photographer for a modeling
                            agency invited me and a couple of friends to a trip to New York City.
                            The modeling agency wanted take their models to the city and help them get
                            signed with even greater agencies in Time Square as well as doing a bunch of
                            photoshoots to establish connections with the local artists. This trip inspired
                            me to pick up photography. I had a lot of experience in photo-manipulation 
                            throughout highschool. Working with the models of Charlotte for a couple years
                            made me realize that there's not much money in this industry and it lost its 
                            spark when I was having to really watch my money. This was then moved to a hobby
                            instead of a career path.

                            primarily worked in the Peninsula(Concord, NC). Learning everything from painting and 
                            drywall to installing tile bathrooms. The person who had taught us to tile gave us a 
                            job offer in Hawai'i. Any sane person without any committments would graciously accept...
                            so we accepted.

                            hotel paid for and company vehicles to drive for leisure. Meeting all kinds of fascinating
                            people from around the world. Going body surfing for lunch...it all didn't fill the now hole
                            that has opened. I left my family in NC and I didn't receive any benefits or retirement program.
                            At this point, it was quite obvious. I need something more stable and closer to home.
