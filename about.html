                            <p class="mainp">I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC. Growing up,
                                    I eventually picked up on technology in highschool.
                                    The Xbox360 really ignited the flame within me. Going from a 
                                    regular gamer to becoming a moderator on a very famous 
                                    game modding website(<a href="https://www.thetechgame.com/" id="ttg">The Tech Game</a>).
                                    A friend and I had released the first modded file for
                                    Call of Duty BlackOps Zombies, a week before the game was
                                    even released.    
                            </p> 
                                
                            <p class="mainp">After highschool, my friend who was a photographer for a modeling
                                agency invited me and a couple of friends to a trip to New York City.
                                The modeling agency wanted take their models to the city and help them get
                                signed with even greater agencies in Time Square as well as doing a bunch of
                                photoshoots to establish connections with the local artists. This trip inspired
                                me to pick up photography. I had a lot of experience in photo-manipulation 
                                throughout highschool. Working with the models of Charlotte for a couple years
                                made me realize that there's not much money in this industry and it lost its 
                                spark when I was having to really watch my money. This was then moved to a hobby
                                instead of a career path.
                            </p>
        
                            <p class="mainp">A couple weeks had gone by before a friend of mine had offerd me a job to help
                                him with general construction. We then began to work with a general contractor who
                                primarily worked in the Peninsula(Concord, NC). Learning everything from painting and 
                                drywall to installing tile bathrooms. The person who had taught us to tile gave us a 
                                job offer in Hawai'i. Any sane person without any committments would graciously accept...
                                so we accepted.
                            </p>
        
                            <p class="mainp">
                                Rennovating resorts on the islands of Hawai'i helped me grow as an individual. Rising through
                                the ranks of the company and becoming the project manager's go to person. Having the 
                                hotel paid for and company vehicles to drive for leisure. Meeting all kinds of fascinating
                                people from around the world. Going body surfing for lunch...it all didn't fill the now hole
                                that has opened. I left my family in NC and I didn't receive any benefits or retirement program.
                                At this point, it was quite obvious. I need something more stable and closer to home.

                                After dabbling in programming by reading some books, A Crash Course to Python/Beginning Django, watching a
